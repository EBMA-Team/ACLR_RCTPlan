# Welcome {.unnumbered}

This interactive book provides a comprehensive framework for designing
contemporary ACL graft research studies using simulation-based
methodology and modern clinical trial design principles.

## Who This Book Is For

-   Orthopedic surgeons planning ACL research studies

-   Clinical researchers seeking to understand modern trial design

-   Biostatisticians working on surgical intervention studies

-   Graduate students in clinical research or biostatistics

-   Research coordinators involved in orthopaedic trials

## How to Use This Book

This book is designed to be interactive and practical. Each chapter
includes:

-   Conceptual explanations of key principles

-   Working R code for implementation

-   Interactive visualizations for exploration

-   Practical templates for real-world application
