# The research program

## First things first

-   Generate a briefing document from a review of the initial conference material

    -   Including some pointed questions about what Dr Helen and Dr Charleton had in mind

## Hive mind

-   Conduct a literature review and attempt to identify the gap the new graft material addresses

## Firewall

-   Establish what, if any, industry involvement in the new graft type will be likely in the future

-   Identify the key preliminary information required to appropriately plan a randomised trial in private practice

-   Sketch out the viability of conducting the trial in terms of logistics and timeframe
